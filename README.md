# Excess Pneumonia Mortality During a Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak in Flint, Michigan

Data and code for the preprint paper with this title.

The main folder file "Frontline_Legionnaires_Analysis" is a reproducible analysis file with all our code. You may run it in RStudio on your local machine.

The folder "data" contains...well, what else, our data as well as the shapefiles we used for the maps.

The folder "model_objects" contains .rds files of 3 models (our primary + 2 sensitivity analyses). The analysis file is set up to simply read these in to save some time (these models take ~3-5 minutes to run on a Dell XPS13 laptop), but you can simply comment and un-comment the appropriate code if you want to check or modify our models, as well!

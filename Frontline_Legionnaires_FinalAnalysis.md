# Abstract

**Introduction**: From June 2014-October 2015, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) reported a Legionnaires' disease (LD) outbreak in Genesee County, Michigan, in which the city of Flint is located. MDHHS' final case count for the LD outbreak was 90 cases, including 12 deaths (10 among Genesee County residents). However, it is likely the true outbreak was larger due to unidentified cases. Specifically, some LD cases may have been categorized as general pneumonia.

**Objective**: To estimate excess pneumonia deaths in Genesee County during the 2014-15 LD outbreak and compare this with reported LD death tolls.

**Methods**: We used data from CDC's WONDER system - which tracks monthly death certificates in each U.S. county - on all non-viral pneumonia and LD (P+LD) deaths in residents of Genesee and similar counties in Michigan and neighboring states from 2011-2017. We used a Bayesian negative binomial model to calculate excess P+LD deaths in Genesee from May 2014-October 2015. We began in May 2014 to capture undiagnosed cases before the first identified case. We mapped these excess deaths to assess whether they overlapped geographically with reported LD cases. 

**Results**: We estimated 67.2 excess P+LD deaths (95% credible interval: 10.6 to 130.0) in Genesee County during the LD outbreak. This is substantially higher than the 10 LD deaths among Genesee County residents reported by MDHHS. There is also geographic overlap of the excess P+LD deaths and LD cases, particularly in western Flint and northwestern non-Flint Genesee County.

**Conclusions**: We identified a large number of excess P+LD deaths during the 2014-15 Genesee County LD outbreak. While these findings on pneumonia deaths are consistent with the hypothesis that the LD outbreak was larger than reported, it remains unclear exactly how much larger the LD outbreak may have been.




# Lay Summary

From June 2014-October 2015, MDHHS reported an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease (LD) in Genesee County, Michigan, home of the city of Flint. This outbreak began shortly after the switch in the water source for the city of Flint from Lake Huron to the Flint River (April 2014). It continued through October 2015, ending after the city of Flint switched back to drawing its water from Lake Huron. The source of the outbreak is currently debated, with the two most likely candiates the municipal water system and McLaren Flint Hospital. The final LD tally reported by state agencies was 90 cases, including 12 deaths (10 of whom were Genesee County residents). 

LD is a bacterial respiratory infection resulting in pneumonia. Because it presents like many other pneumonias and can typically be treated with antibiotics, many cases go undetected. This is particularly true when an LD outbreak is not known or suspected.

State agencies reported 10 total LD deaths among Genesee County residents during the outbreak. Using data from a CDC-maintained national death reporting system, we estimated that from May 2014-October 2015 there were in fact *67.2 (95% credible interval: 10.6 to 130.0)* more total pneumonia and LD (P+LD) deaths among Genesee County residents than we would have expected based on what was happening in similar Midwestern counties. These extra deaths also overlapped geographically with many of the reported LD cases. 

Although the first LD case identified by the state was admitted to the hospital in June 2014, pneumonia deaths began an unseasonable uptick in May. This fact, along with the likelihood that the first identified LD case was not the first actual LD case, prompted us to begin counting excess pneumonia deaths in May rather than June. 

Taken together, our results suggest the true death toll - and overall size of the LD outbreak - may have been larger than reported by the state. How much is an open question. There were 6-7x more extra P+LD deaths than reported LD deaths (67.2 vs. 10), but it is unlikely all of these extra deaths were due to LD. Some of them may have been caused by increases in other respiratory diseases or as a consequence of other stresses from the water crisis. This would suggest the true size of the outbreak was somewhere between what MDHHS reported and 6-7x higher. That said, the increase we observed is *specific to Genesee County*, meaning whatever caused these 67.2 deaths should have been occurring there and not elsewhere, even if it was not LD. 

It is also possible some LD deaths were not diagnosed as LD or pneumonia and therefore were not included in our 67.1 extra deaths. Furthermore, it is also possible that LD *cases* were even harder to identify than *deaths*. In other words, the true non-fatal case count could have been even more than 6-7x higher. Because there is no way to retroactively identify undiagnosed LD cases or deaths, it is difficult to know exactly how much larger the total LD outbreak was. 

In any event, the data suggests the LD outbreak was, in fact, larger than reported.

Because LD is a nationally notifiable disease, it is important to note that the state of Michigan almost certainly reported all the cases made known to them by health care providers and laboratories diagnosing the cases. However, the outbreak was not announced publicly until January 2016. Earlier detection and awareness of the outbreak may have allowed identification of additional cases by alerting the medical community and the public to the risk of LD.







# Analysis Setup

First we need to load some necessary packages.

```r
  pacman::p_load(readxl, tidyverse, rstudioapi, rmarkdown, lubridate, epitools, gridExtra, knitr, kableExtra, viridis, stringr, sf, rvest, rgdal, sp, ggsn, RColorBrewer, maptools, here, rgeos, ggthemes, grid, cowplot, ggpubr, brms, tidybayes)
```



# Methods


## Data Sources

Then we need to load our data:


### Data for Analysis of Excess Pneumonia + LD Deaths


1. CDC-reported non-viral pneumonia and LD deaths for residents of Genesee County, MI and 45 control counties.
      
    This is mortality data from [CDC's WONDER Multiple Cause of Death tool](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10.html), which collates information from death certificates nationwide. 

    We pulled data for Genesee County, Michigan and 45 control counties: other "Medium Metro" counties (per [National Center for  Health Statistics 2013 Urbanization Classifications]((https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm))) in Michigan and neighboring states (IL, IN, OH, WI). These counties include metropolitan areas with similar climates to Flint (e.g. Rockford, IL; Ft. Wayne and Evansville, IN; Lansing, MI; and Youngstown, Toledo, and Dayton, OH) and were chosen to reflect the counterfactual of what would have happened to pneumonia deaths in Genesee County absent the LD outbreak, water switch, and other attendant public health changes.

    Deaths were identified in WONDER's Multiple Cause of Death file using ICD-10 codes J15-J18 for non-viral pneumonia plus A48.1 and A48.2 for LD. Pneumonia or LD could appear as any cause of death. LD deaths represented a very small fraction of total pneumonia deaths: there were 24,842 pneumonia deaths in the 45 control counties from 2011-2017 and only 38 (<0.2%) known additional LD deaths during that same time period. The CDC WONDER death counts just for Genesee County are occasionally suppressed because they're <10 per month; in such cases we assumed 10 deaths during the month.
    
       This file also includes monthly LD case counts from [MDHHS' final chartbook report on the outbreak](https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIDHHS/2018/05/29/file_attachments/1014713/GC%2BLegionella%2BChartBook%2BFINAL.pdf).
       


2. Monthly population for Genesee and control counties.

    County-level population data was gathered from the Census and American Fact Finder, Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Selected Age Groups by Sex for the United States, States, Counties and Puerto Rico Commonwealth and Municipios: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017 table (PEPAGESEX). We assumed a simple linear population change between mid-year (July 1) estimates for all counties.
    
    
    ```r
    # Using here() and a folder named 'data' to load files
    # here()
    # Inside here() should be a folder labeled 'data' with all line list data
    # Inside here() should be a secon folder labeled 'shapefiles' with county and census tract shapefiles
    
    #Load monthly CDC WONDER control data + MDHHS LD case counts
    pneu_wonder <- read_excel(path=here("data/WONDER_Data.xlsx"),
                          sheet = "WONDER") 
    
    #Load month-to-quarter lookup table
    qtrs <- read.csv(here("data/quarters.csv"))
    # colnames(qtrs) <- c("Month_Code", "Quarter", "Month", "FluSeason")
    #NOTE: "FluSeason = 2013" runs from October 2012-September 2013, and so on. Because
    #"pneumonia" deaths often vary substantially based on flu severity we chose to use a
    #October-September rather than a traditional calendar year to control for long-term
    #year-to-year changes in pneumonia mortality.
    
     #Load county-level population data
      #NOTE: Monthly populations calculated in Excel assuming linear trend between Census midpoint (July 1) estimates for each year
      pop <- read_excel(path = here("data/WONDER_Data.xlsx"),
                    sheet = "Pop_Census_AFF")
      pop <- pop[, -grep("Mid", colnames(pop))]
      
    #Load all Genesee County pneumonia deaths
    pneu_genesee <- read_excel(path=here("data/Deidentified Pneumonia deaths GeoId.xlsx"),
                          sheet = "All",
                          col_types = c("numeric", "date", "text", "text", "numeric"))
    ```
    

### Data for Mapping Analyses

3. Genesee County LD cases. 

    This file was provided by the journalists at *Frontline*. Note that this data includes 67 cases and 33 deaths. MDHHS' final report, in contrast, reports 90 cases and 12 deaths (10 of whom were Genesee County residents). 

    The *Frontline* list was based off a line list of 46 cases from Genesee County that covers the first "wave" from June 2014-March 2015 (MDHHS's final chartbook indicates there were 44 rather than 46 cases during this time period); a second wave ran from May 2015-October 2015, but per *Frontline* no one has gotten the full case list for that time period. *Frontline* then identified 31 additional cases from legal cases and news reports, for 67 total cases. 
    
    *Frontline* considered anyone who died at any time after contracting LD is included as a death in this list. MDHHS only classified patients who died within 30 days of contracting LD as an LD death. This explains the 21 additional deaths in the *Frontline* list.

    The Frontline data thus: 
      + is missing 23 LD cases 
      + identifies 21 additional deaths outside the 30-day window used by MDHHS
      
    Each LD case is also given a GEOID, the components of which are:
      + STATE CODE: FIRST 2 DIGITS 
      + COUNTY CODE: NEXT 3 DIGITS
      + CENSUS TRACT: LAST 6 DIGITS 

      A note on dates used in the mapping analysis:  
      + For LD cases, the data includes a date of death (if the patient died) and a date of hospital admission. Of the 67 cases in the *Frontline* list, 57 have a hospital admission date and an additional 3 have a date of death only (missing hospitalization date). In the mapping analysis, we use date of death for cases who died within 30 days of their hospital admit date and the date of hospital admission for other cases.  
      + For pneumonia deaths, death date is always used as this is the data available on the death certificate. 
        
        We excluded 9 cases that were not known Genesee residents and 3 additional surviving cases without a hospital admission date. The number of cases used for the mapping analysis is 55.

4. Genesee County Pneumonia Deaths with mapping data.

    This file was provided by *Frontline*, who abstracted the data from death certificates they obtained from the Genesee County Vital Records Division (GCVRD)/Clerks' Office via a FOIA Request. This death list differs from the CDC WONDER list, but the exact source of these differences is unknown. These deaths are used only for the mapping portion of the analysis.

    This file includes all those who died in Genesee County, but GEOIDs are provided only for those who were residents of Genesee County. There are 2041 total pnuemonia deaths in this file. 280 were non-Genesee County residents, and 10 additional cases lacked GEOIDs. Thus there are 1,751 Genesee County pneumonia deaths with location information in this dataset. These are the pneumonia deaths we'll map by census tract of residence.
      

5. Shapefiles for Michigan showing census tract boundaries in Genesee County.

     2010 Census County and census-tract level shapefiles for Michigan were obtained from [here](http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2010-census-tracts-v17a).


6. Census tract-level population data. 

    Census tract-level population data was obtained from the [Census and American Fact Finder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t).

## Data Cleaning and Wrangling

The code used for cleaning and wrangling the data is below. In a nutshell, to prepare for visualizing and modeling excess non-viral pneumonia + LD deaths we: 

* Counted the *Frontline* pneumonia deaths and linked them to WONDER data (for a sensitivity analysis only)
* Calculated total population for Genesee and control counties for each month and linked this to the CDC WONDER death data
* Calculated a mortality rate and 95% CIs around the rate using a Poisson distribution



```r
#Count Genesee County pneumonia deaths by month and link to WONDER data
pd_link <- pd %>% 
  mutate(DateOfDeath = as.Date(DateOfDeath, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>%

## Analysis of Excess Pneumonia + LD Deaths

### Visualizing Deaths Over Time

**Figure 1a** is a plot of P+LD death rates by month and year for Genesee County and the 45 control counties, both from WONDER. The time between the vertical blue lines delineate the start and end of the Flint municipal water source change from Detroit to the Flint River (04/25/2014-10/16/2015); the vertical green lines delineate the official start and end of the Flint LD outbreak per MDHHS (June 2014-October 2015). The shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the monthly rates.

**Figure 1b** depicts Genesee County LD cases by month per MDHHS.

While the Genesee County pneumonia mortality data typically tracks with that of the control counties (rising when it rises, falling when it falls, albeit with quite a bit of noise), there is a clear 6-month period beginning in May 2014 where the two lines diverge, with Genesee remaining elevated while the control counties fall. This is during a time (spring/summer) where we would be expecting pneumonia deaths to fall but LD deaths to rise. Thus this suggests we may be seeing the beginning of the LD outbreak reflected in the pneumonia mortality numbers.

Curiously, we do not same the same *clear* divergence in 2015. That said, pneumonia deaths still appear to be elevated. The pneumonia death rate in Genesee County is above that of the control counties for 5 months in 2015; this only happened in 7 months from 2011-2013.

**Figure 2** zooms in on **Figure 1a** for just the period around the LD outbreak to emphasize the divergence immediately following the water switch.

### Statistical Models

We will now use a statistical model to try and confirm or deny what we spotted with our eyes in **Figure 1a**.

Below we run a Bayesian negative binomial model for pneumonia death rates in Genesee County and control counties from 2011-2017. In layman's-ish terms, we're trying to predict the expected pneumonia deaths in Genesee and control counties based on the month, year, location (Genesee vs. control), and whether we are during the LD outbreak or not. 

While the official state report identified the first LD case as being admitted to the hospital in early June 2014, we elected to treat the outbreak as beginning in May 2014 for the following reasons:

* An unseasonal uptick in pneumonia deaths began in Genesee in May 2014, a time when we would expect most pneumonia deaths to drop but LD deaths to rise
* Per the state health department, the first LD case was admitted to the hospital on June 10, 2014. Given the incubation period of LD, this means LD was plausibly in the wild and infecting residents in May 2014.
* It is probable that the first detected LD case was not the first true LD case due to a lack of regular testing.
* The objective of our analysis is to use pneumonia deaths to identify undetected LD cases, including before the first detected case.

We show the results of beginning our count of excess pneumonia deaths in June 2014 in a sensitivity analysis.

We split the outbreak into two periods: an "early" period during the first 6 months of LD (May-October 2014, a time during which pneumonia deaths were particularly elevated in **Figure 1a**), and a "late" period of the 12 succeeding months until the final LD case (November 2014-October 2015). We elected to use two periods because pneumonia mortality was particularly elevated during the early period, and including the periods separately generated a model with substantially better fit than a single term for the full outbreak period.

The main coefficients of interest here are the interaction between geography and whether we are during the outbreak (Geo_ob). These coefficients are positive, suggesting that there is an elevated non-viral pneumonia + LD death rate in Genesee specifically during the late (0.17) and especially early (0.33) portions of the outbreak, after accounting for trends in pneumonia mortality in control counties.

Visualizing this model hopefully makes our conclusions clearer. **Figure 3** plots the actual pneumonia death rates (translucent solid lines) as well as the predictions from our model (dashed lines). The shaded areas are the 95% credible intervals for the model's mean predictions. Before and after the outbreak Genesee's pneumonia rate (red) is generally slightly below that of the control counties (blue). During the LD outbreak, however, it is higher than the blue line, particularly during the early period.

Note that the lines are only allowed to diverge during the two LD periods because that's how we coded our model. The point is that when we *allow* the lines to diverge (because we would expect LD to be affecting the rates during these times), they do.

There were about 67.2 (95% credible interval: 10.6 to 130.0) more pneumonia deaths in Genesee County during the LD outbreak than we would have expected based on what was happening in similar counties during this same time. MDHHS reported 10 official LD deaths among Genesee County residents during this period.

During the early stage of the outbreak (6 months), when the largest gap was evident in **Figure 1a**, there were 32.0 (95% credible interval: 9.6 to 58.2) excess pneumonia deaths versus 4 LD deaths reported by MDHHS among Genesee residents.

During the late stage of the outbreak (12 months) there were 35.2 (95% credible interval: 1.0 to 71.7) excess pneumonia deaths versus 6 Genesee resident LD deaths reported by MDHHS.

Most of the LD cases are in west Flint census tracts, with some cases in outlying census tracts around Flint. There are, in particular, some census tracts northwest of Flint that seem to have a particularly high number of LD cases. Note that these rates are not adjusted for any population characteristics, including age.

The maps above are informative, because they show chronological changes in LD/pneumonia deaths through time. But, our question of interest was whether the increase in pnuemonia deaths that we detected occurred in the same geographic areas as LD cases. To test this, we'll look at a map of the *change* in pneumonia mortality (during vs. before the LD outbreak) compared with the locations of LD cases. 

### Calculate and map difference between pneumonia mortality rates before and during the outbreak

<img src="Frontline_Legionnaires_FinalAnalysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We see that generally, areas in west Flint and northwest of Flint had higher pneumonia mortality during the LD outbreak than before. That this spike in pneumonia mortality occurred in the same areas as many LD cases lived is consistent with the notion that at least some of the excess pneumonia mortality in Genesee County during this period was could have been due to undiagnosed LD cases in these areas. 

There are several key assumptions being made here, namely that undiagnosed LD cases would have lived in generally the same areas as diagnosed LD cases. This may not be true if undiagnosed LD cases were systematically different from diagnosed cases with respect to their likelihood of being diagnosed; for example, if healthcare access is generally better in some areas of Flint than others. We cannot completely rule this out as a potential explanation for our findings. 

The geographic clustering of cases in specific areas suggests that there were regions in Genesee County with either individuals who were at higher risk of LD (for example, due to older age), or higher exposure to water containing Legionnaires' bacteria. There does exist some evidence that water age, which is a marker of poor water quality, may have been higher in west Flint relative to other areas, though we cannot definitively say that this was the cause of the LD outbreak or the elevated pneumonia mortality that we see. That said, the clear geographic overlap between pneumonia mortality and LD cases is further evidence that at least some of the excess pneumonia mortality estimated is likely due to LD.






# Sensitivity Analyses

We also ran several sensitivity analyses, the most important of which are shown below.

### Analysis With Special Term for 2017

Below is the statistical model repeated using WONDER data on pneumonia and LD deaths but with a separate term for the year 2017, when pneumonia deaths were elevated in Genesee for reasons unrelated to the 2014-15 LD outbreak.

  mutate(Geography = case_when(Geography == "Genesee" ~ "Genesee",
                               TRUE ~ "Control Medium Metro"),

Giving 2017 its own term nearly *doubles* our estimate of the excess pneumonia deaths from 67 to 119. This is because in addition to during the LD outbreak pneumonia deaths in Genesee were also elevated relative to control counties in 2017 - we do not have an explanation for why. Including a separate interaction term for Genesee and 2017 sets the referent group against which we compare the LD outbreak as {January 2011-April 2014, January 2016-December 2016} rather than {January 2011-April 2014, January 2016-December *2017*}. During the former time frame Genesee pneumonia deaths rates were lower relative to control counties than during the latter, inflating the estimate of how much higher pneumonia death rates were during the LD outbreak. 

This model also provides a better fit as seen in Figure A1, particularly in 2017. However, we relegated this to a sensitivity analysis as it was not our initial modeling objective and we do not have an explanation for why Genesee pneumonia death rates were elevated in 2017, leading us to feel like we might be improperly cherry-picking a control time period.


### Begin Counting Excess Deaths in June 2014 Rather Than May 2014

Below is the statistical model repeated using WONDER data on pneumonia and LD deaths but defining the period in which we count excess deaths as beginning in June 2014 (the month of the first reported LD case) rather than May 2014 (when we consider the outbreak likely to have begun for reasons listed above).

This causes our estimate of excess pneumonia deaths to drop slightly from 67.1 to 61.3 (95% credible interval: 7.4 to 122.6). It does not substantively change our conclusions, however.

### Mapping by Quadrant Rather than Census Tract

Since number of cases/deaths in individual census tracts can be small, we wanted to look at these same maps but with Flint and non-Flint census tracts aggregated in quadrants. Note the different color scale on these maps as compared to the previous maps.



```r
ld_plot_quad <- ggarrange(ld_map_frst6mo_quad, ld_map_out_quad, ncol=2, common.legend = TRUE, legend="bottom")
annotate_figure(ld_plot_quad, top = text_grob("Figure A3. Legionnaire's cases in Genesee County, MI by census tract\nMay 2014 - October 2015", face = "bold"))
```

These maps are not substantively different as maps showing census tract-level data.
